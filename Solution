The measure is called the 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡\n, 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)\n. In training you measure the cost over all of our training samples 𝑥(𝑖),𝑦(𝑖)\n𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)=12𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))2(2)\n\nIn lecture, gradient descent was described as:\n\nrepeat𝑤𝑏} until convergence:{=𝑤−𝛼∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑤=𝑏−𝛼∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑏(3)\nwhere, parameters 𝑤\n, 𝑏\n are updated simultaneously.\nThe gradient is defined as:\n∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑤∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑏=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))𝑥(𝑖)=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))(4)(5)\n\nHere simultaniously means that you calculate the partial derivatives for all the parameters before updating any of the parameters.\n\n\nImplement Gradient Descent\nYou will implement gradient descent algorithm for one feature.

On the right side of the plot, the derivative is positive, while on the left it is negative. Due to the 'bowl shape', the derivatives will always lead gradient descent toward the bottom where the gradient is zero.\n\nThe left plot has fixed 𝑏=100\n. Gradient descent will utilize both ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑤\n and ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑏\n to update parameters. The 'quiver plot' on the right provides a means of viewing the gradient of both parameters. The arrow sizes reflect the magnitude of the gradient at that point. The direction and slope of the arrow reflects the ratio of ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑤\n and ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑏\n at that point. Note that the gradient points away from the minimum. Review equation (3) above. The scaled gradient is subtracted from the current value of 𝑤\n or 𝑏\n. This moves the parameter in a direction that will reduce cost.\n\n\nGradient Descent\nNow that gradients can be computed, gradient descent, described in equation (3) above can be implemented below in gradient_descent. The details of the implementation are described in the comments. Below, you will utilize this function to find optimal values of 𝑤\n and 𝑏\n on the training data.\n\ndef gradient_descent(x, y, w_in, b_in, alpha, num_iters, cost_function, gradient_function): \n    \"\"\"\n    Performs gradient descent to fit w,b.

As shown in the diagram from the lecture, as the process nears the 'bottom of the bowl' progress is slower due to the smaller value of the derivative at that point.\nprogress slows though the learning rate, alpha, remains fixed\nCost versus iterations of gradient descent\nA plot of cost versus iterations is a useful measure of progress in gradient descent. Cost should always decrease in successful runs. The change in cost is so rapid initially, it is useful to plot the initial decent on a different scale than the final descent. In the plots below, note the scale of cost on the axes and the iteration step.\n\n# plot cost versus iteration  \nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, constrained_layout=True, figsize=(12,4))\nax1.plot(J_hist[:100])\nax2.plot(1000 + np.arange(len(J_hist[1000:])), J_hist[1000:])\nax1.set_title(\"Cost vs. iteration(start)\");  ax2.set_title(\"Cost vs. iteration (end)\")\nax1.set_ylabel('Cost')            ;  ax2.set_ylabel('Cost') \nax1.set_xlabel('iteration step')  ;  ax2.set_xlabel('iteration step') \nplt.show()\nPredictions\nNow that you have discovered the optimal values for the parameters 𝑤\n and 𝑏\n, you can now use the model to predict housing values based on our learned parameters. As expected, the predicted values are nearly the same as the training values for the same housing. Further, the value not in the prediction is in line with the expected value.\n\nprint(f\"1000 sqft house prediction {w_final*1.0 + b_final:0.1f} Thousand dollars\")\nprint(f\"1200 sqft house prediction {w_final*1.2 + b_final:0.1f} Thousand dollars\")\nprint(f\"2000 sqft house prediction {w_final*2.0 + b_final:0.1f} Thousand dollars\")\n\nPlotting\nYou can show the progress of gradient descent during its execution by plotting the cost over iterations on a contour plot of the cost(w,b).\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(12, 6))\nplt_contour_wgrad(x_train, y_train, p_hist, ax)\nAbove, the contour plot shows the 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡(𝑤,𝑏)\n over a range of 𝑤\n and 𝑏\n. Cost levels are represented by the rings. Overlayed, using red arrows, is the path of gradient descent. Here are some things to note:\n\nThe path makes steady (monotonic) progress toward its goal.\ninitial steps are much larger than the steps near the goal.\nZooming in, we can see that final steps of gradient descent. Note the distance between steps shrinks as the gradient approaches zero.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(12, 4))\nplt_contour_wgrad(x_train, y_train, p_hist, ax, w_range=[180, 220, 0.5], b_range=[80, 120, 0.5],\n            contours=[1,5,10,20],resolution=0.5)\n\nIncreased Learning Rate\n\nIn the lecture, there was a discussion related to the proper value of the learning rate, 𝛼\n in equation(3). The larger 𝛼\n is, the faster gradient descent will converge to a solution. But, if it is too large, gradient descent will diverge. Above you have an example of a solution which converges nicely.\nLet's try increasing the value of 𝛼\n and see what happens:\n\n# initialize parameters\nw_init = 0\nb_init = 0\n# set alpha to a large value\niterations = 10\ntmp_alpha = 8.0e-1\n# run gradient descent\nw_final, b_final, J_hist, p_hist = gradient_descent(x_train ,y_train, w_init, b_init, tmp_alpha, \n                                                    iterations, compute_cost, compute_gradient)\nAbove, 𝑤\n and 𝑏\n are bouncing back and forth between positive and negative with the absolute value increasing with each iteration. Further, each iteration ∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑤\n changes sign and cost is increasing rather than decreasing. This is a clear sign that the learning rate is too large and the solution is diverging. Let's visualize this with a plot.\n\nplt_divergence(p_hist, J_hist,x_train, y_train)\nplt.show()\nAbove, the left graph shows 𝑤\n's progression over the first few steps of gradient descent. 𝑤\n oscillates from positive to negative and cost grows rapidly. Gradient Descent is operating on both 𝑤\n and 𝑏\n simultaneously, so one needs the 3-D plot on the right for the complete picture.\n\nCongratulations!\nIn this lab you:\n\ndelved into the details of gradient descent for a single variable.\ndeveloped a routine to compute the gradient\nvisualized what the gradient is\ncompleted a gradient descent routine\nutilized gradient descent to find parameters\nexamined the impact of sizing the learning rate","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
